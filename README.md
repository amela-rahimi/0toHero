0ToHero 

0ToHero is a group that was created to make a software application in order to solve a business problem.
The name of the group describes our path in programming and in the business field. 
Our team has six members, where every of them has an important role. 
The main idea of our team is to make a software application for a kindergarten. 
Kindergarten is a family business that is owned by a team member in our group, 
so it is a concrete business and we think that our software application will solve a real world problem.
We will focus more in managing the inventory, human resources and finance department. 
As business informatics students, we are trying to figure out also the economic view of the business 
and bring all these elements together in a platform as software application. 
The business that we are working with has 170 children also a pre-elementary school 
 Our software will cover both parts of the business, so it will be functional for these parts. 
 We are thinking to name this application ‘ABC’ since this is the name of the kindergarten. 
 What is important to highlight is that all our team members see this project not just as a school project, but beyond that.
 For us this is a challenge and we will try to give our best and finally make this project functional to be used by this business.
